recursive query

 with RECURSIVE countdown(val) as (
 select 3 as val  -- initial or no recursive query
 union  -- always have union keyword
 select val-1 from countdown where val>1  -- recrusive query
 )

 select * from countdown;

recursive query created result table and working table behind the scene, it will have one single column 'val'
result table				working table
val							val
3							1
2
1


if you want to follow graph like structure in that case recursive query is helpful
