to check constrain for table 


INFORMATION_SCHEMA provides access to database metadata.

Metadata is data about the data, such as the name of a database or table, the data type of a column, or access privileges. Other terms that sometimes are used for this information are data dictionary and system catalog

SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.table_constraints where table_name='users';


in where clause we do math cal for column like *,+,_,?

-- while designing database general google for database

relation 
1) one to one relation
2) many to many relation
3) one to many relation => has many
4) many to one relation => has one

employess has one companies
companies has many offices=> offices contain offices id as foreign key
offices has many employess => employee id foreign key

generally foreign key has to many side
1) when we try to add column in user_id column which not referring to the id column in user	
we will get error which will help for data consistence
2) for some reason we insert null value in foreign key it will inset the value

we can add on delete option for foreign key constrain
1) on delete cascade=> delete photo to !
2) on delete set null=> set the 'user_id' of the photo to null
3) on delete set default=> set 'user_id' of the photo to the default value if one is provided

primary key =not null and unique value which help to identify row uniquely
For sql server cluster index is created when we assign primary key

create table office(
id integer primary key,
department varchar(20)
);

create table employee(
id integer primary key,
name varchar(20),
office_id integer references office(id)
);


// column level primary key 
create table category(
id serial primary key,
name varchar(20),
)

// table level primary key which will help to add composite key
create table category(
id serial ,
name varchar(20),
primary key(id)
)

create table category(
id serial ,
name varchar(20),
constraint pk_category_id primary key(id)  // give default constraint name 
);

// drop key

alter table products
drop constraint products_pkey;

// two way of adding key 
alter table products
add  primary key(id);


// we have give constraint name for primary key if we do not provide database will provide the constraint automatically for you
alter table products
add constraint product_id primary key(id);
