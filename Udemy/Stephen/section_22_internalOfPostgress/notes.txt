show data_directory => give the location at where data is stored
- go to the base directory where data is stored

select oid , datname from pg_database;
to check oid of each database
oid = internal identifier (oid mean object identifier)

select * from pg_class;
to find each file in oid

find manually user table oid 


heap file =file that contain all data (rows) of our table
Tuples or item= indivisaul row of table
block or page=The heap file is divided into many diff block or page. Each block/page store some number of rows  always 8kb size

for vs code we need to add hex editor plugin to see binary file
1kb = 896 bytes


Item					Description
PageHeaderData			24 bytes long. Contains general information about the page, including free space pointers.
ItemIdData				Array of item identifiers pointing to the actual items. Each entry is an (offset,length) pair. 4 bytes per item.
Free space				The unallocated space. New item identifiers are allocated from the start of this area, new items from the end.
Items					The actual items themselves.
Special space			Index access method specific data. Different methods store different data. Empty in ordinary tables.


header information contain 
pd-lower value=> no of byte start of page to start of free space
pd-upper => end of free space 

after header information to free space all 4 bytes are itemid data
itemid contain start of item it and length of the item

so in general 
heap file contain information about page , itemid ,free space
