subquery can be used in 3 place =>identifying structure of data return by each query 
select => should return single value 
from or join  => should return rows or we can return single result
where=>should return source column


subquery in form 
 
select
  p.name,
  p.price_weight_ratio
FROM
  (
    select
      name,
      price / weight as price_weight_ratio
    FROM
      products 
  ) as p WHERE p.price_weight_ratio>5;

from clause can return single result or set of multiple row and column our outer clause should be match with from subquery result
2. we need to give alias for subquery in order to work 

< all(subquery)=> should return the result of single column
< some(subquery)=> should return result of single column ; some is alias any

50 > some(20,100) ==> this will return true
50> some(10,20)==> this will return false

note: aggregate function can not be nested
