rules for like
1) user can like single post
2) user can unlike the post
3) need to find how many like to the post
4) need to find how like the post (may be top 3 )
5) we may should consider the user can like comment
6) user may want to dislike post (or add other reaction)

== we can create like with user_id and post_id and add unique constrain to the both table which will give ensure user can like on one post

add comments like 
1) polymorphic association

 we have column which refer to the to table 
 eg. liked_id and liked_type(comment, post) here we can not add foreign key constraints to liked_id. so can add liked_id=999 which doesnot refer to any column 
 which result in data inconsistance 
 
 2) alternative approch
 add post_id and comment_id to likes table and we still want to make sure post_id or comment_id should not be null
 
 coalesce(post_id::boolean::integer,0)+coalesce((comment_id)::boolean::integer,0)=1
 
 coalesce return the value between 2 argument which is not null
 
 downside: if user has many other options to like eg posts, live stream then we need 
 to add many diff column and need to add check 
 
 3) create posts_like and comment_likes table with column user_id and comment_id
this apporch will be greate if we have addintion content types of lik 
 
 among above 3 approch we will use 2 nd apporch
