full table scan=
select * from users where name ="max"
then database need to load heap file from the hard drive to the ram(memory) and need to scan the result
this is know as full table scan

suppose we have some mechanism which will tell on which block 'max' is stored so database can load only this block to the RAM and search for 'max'

this mechanism is called index (index is another type of data structure)

How index work ?
find on which column we want to create index for above example it's name 
so it will go throw each name and find block/index number for each row eg. 'max' block no2 and index 1
so we have recorded block number and index for each records for username

then sort this data in meaningful way 
organize this into tree like data 
root node -> leaf node 1 && leaf node 2 
- add helper to the root node which will help to go specific leaf node 

how to create index
create index on users(username);  -- users table and username column
if do not provide index database will give name users_username_idx 

to drop index
drop index users_username_idx ; -- drop index indexName;

add keyword 'explain analyze' before query to check how much time takes to execute the query

downside of index's ->
for storing index hard drive memory is used 
select pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('users')); use this query to check memory used
-- having index slow down insert,update and deletion
-- index might not be used by Postgres
-- cost of storage for cloud providers

index types->
b tree index and some other type but 99% b tree index is used

automatically generated index ->
for primary key and unique key , Postgres automatically created the index for table but this index's does not show under pg admin

-- to check index for pk and unique
select relname,relkind from pg_class where relkind='i';


behind the scene for index->

create extension pageinspect; -- run this commond on pg admin
select * from bt_metap('users_username_idx');-- bt b tree , mtp stands for metaspace 

index uses same structure for storing data which we have seen earlier
