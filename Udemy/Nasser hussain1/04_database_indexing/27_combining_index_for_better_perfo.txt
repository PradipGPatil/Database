create index on test(a,b);

select analyze select c from test where a=7;

this query will do bimap scan on test_a_b_idx index because we want to find c. Because it on left hand side scaning a will be simple 



select analyze select c from test where b=7;
it will not use index scan because b is at right hand side so it will go for full table scan 

select analyze select c from test where a=7 and b=10;
it will index only scan 


select analyze select c from test where a=7 or b=10;
it will go for full table scan
